    -First we have a function called fileIn that takes in the file as a string using a scanner
        -This string is then split at each space to create a list of words
    -This list of words is then sent to a function called checkWords which will keep track of the
    total number of each word
    -This data is then sent to a function called output
        -The data is then displayed as a histogram
