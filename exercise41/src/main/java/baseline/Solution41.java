    -Read in the data of the file using the scanner class
    -This operation is done in a function called input
    -Then that data is taken as an arrayList of strings and brought to a function called sort
        -The data will be sorted using nested for loops, a brute force method
    -The sorted array is then passed to an output function that will display the list in a tabular format
