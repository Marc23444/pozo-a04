    -Create a function called fileIn that takes in the file a single string
        -The user will enter the name of the file
        -A try catch block will be used to make sure the file exists
    -Then split that string at each space character creating an array of strings
    -Pass that string array to a function called checkString that looks for all
    occurrences of the word utilize and replaces them with the word use
    -Then pass that modified array to a function called fileOut
    -Finally write this modified string array to a new file called "exercise45_output.txt"
